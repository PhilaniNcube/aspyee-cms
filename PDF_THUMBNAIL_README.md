# PDF Thumbnail Feature

This project now includes PDF thumbnail generation functionality that automatically creates preview images for PDF files in the file display components.

## Components Added

### 1. PDFThumbnail Component

Location: `src/components/ui/pdf-thumbnail.tsx`

A React component that renders the first page of a PDF document as a thumbnail image using PDF.js.

**Features:**

- Client-side PDF rendering
- Automatic scaling to fit thumbnail dimensions
- Loading states and error handling
- Fallback to file icon on error

**Usage:**

```tsx
<PDFThumbnail url={pdfUrl} alt="PDF preview" className="w-full h-full" />
```

### 2. OptimizedPDFThumbnail Component

Location: `src/components/ui/optimized-pdf-thumbnail.tsx`

An optimized version that uses caching to avoid re-rendering the same PDFs.

**Features:**

- Built-in caching system
- Better performance for repeated renders
- Simplified API

### 3. PDF Utilities

Location: `src/lib/pdf-utils.ts`

Utility functions for PDF thumbnail generation with caching.

**Functions:**

- `generatePDFThumbnail(url: string)` - Generates a data URL thumbnail
- `clearThumbnailCache()` - Clears the thumbnail cache

## Integration

The PDF thumbnail functionality has been integrated into the main file display component (`src/components/ui/file-display.tsx`) and will automatically show PDF previews for any PDF files in:

- Grid view
- Card view (default)
- List view (uses file icon, but can be extended)

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The component automatically detects PDF files by checking the MIME type (`application/pdf`)
2. **Rendering**: Uses PDF.js to load and render the first page of the PDF
3. **Scaling**: Automatically scales the thumbnail to fit the container while maintaining aspect ratio
4. **Fallback**: Shows a file icon if PDF rendering fails
5. **Performance**: Includes loading states and error handling

## Browser Support

- Works in all modern browsers that support Canvas API
- PDF.js is loaded dynamically to avoid SSR issues
- Graceful fallback to file icons when PDF.js is not available

## Example

When you have a PDF file in your file display, instead of seeing just a generic PDF icon, users will now see a preview of the actual first page of the document, making it much easier to identify and preview content.

## Dependencies

- `pdfjs-dist` - PDF.js library for PDF rendering
- No additional type dependencies needed (PDF.js includes its own types)

The feature is now ready to use and will automatically apply to all PDF files displayed through the file display components.
